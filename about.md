I'm a Data Analyst interested in causal inference, bayesian statistics, 
and applications of them to electoral politics. Currently I'm interested in opportunities involving 
answerning difficult social science questions using modern statistical methods. 

### Bio

I graduated from the George Washington University with degrees in Mathematics and Political Science in 2017, 
when I was fortunate enough to discover a love of interacting politics with statistics by interning at [Catalist](https://catalist.us/).
I then spent two years at [MIT Election Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/) as a Senior Research
Support Associate, where I spent time thinking about how voting laws affect how we vote, and how to measure how elections 
are run. During this time, I was also lucky enough to take graduate coursework in statistics and causal inference. 
I then did a short stint at [Clarity Campaign Labs](https://www.claritycampaigns.com/), where I helped run and design surveys, 
and did more work applying observational causal inference to quesitons regarding voting. 
Most recently, I was a Special Projects Analyst on the Elizabeth Warren for President Campaign, where I helped answer questions regarding experiments and resource allocation. This was an honor of a lifetime 
to work with such a talented and dedicated data and analytics group. I'm currently searching for opportunities involving 
answering difficult and relevant social science questions with modern statistical methods- if you have any, please send them my way!
